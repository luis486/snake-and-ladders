# Snake and Ladders

Together we have created the best snake and ladder game to spend some time playing with friends🐍🕹.

## Starting 🚀

Below you can see a little about our work and also gratitude to all those people who collaborated in the realization of this project. Thanks to the people who collaborated with us we have created a wonderful game 🤝👫.

## ¿How the game was made 👀🤔?

The game was created using the java development environment and using mainly linked lists and recursion, a small method was also made to save all the players who won in the game in an lmh file, that is, each time you run the program you can see the current winners of different games🏆.

### Pre-requirements 📋

🖥🖱You must have java version 8.0 or higher to successfully run the game or to modify it.

🖥🖱The game is created to be used on Windows or MacOs.

🖥🖱A code editor with which you feel familiar in the Java environment.

### Program installation 👨‍💻👩‍💻🔐

To download the project it is recommended to have previously installed git to make downloading easier. The first thing you will do is go to the green button where it says (CLONE) to have the github link and install it through git, it will give you a folder with the complete program, its requirements, documentation, source code, ect.

### ¿How can I play?👾🎮?

Briefly I will explain to you, the game consists of a small simulation of the board game "Snakes and ladders" of which you will have a symbol to play and a dice to advance your "token" throw your dice, if you fall on a ladder, you can go up to a corresponding part, fall into a snake and you will go back the same way, you can simulate the game or cut the game and go back to the menu.

## Built with 🛠️👨‍💻👩‍💻

Visual studio code and a lot of disposition!🙌🤩🥳.
